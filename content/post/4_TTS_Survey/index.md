## Brief Intro

Text-to-speech (TTS), also known as speech synthesis, aims to synthesize intelligible and natural speech from text. Neural TTS adopts DNNs as the model backbone for speech synthesis.

There are three key components in neural TTS. The text analysis module converts a text sequence into linguistic features, the acoustic models generate acoustic features from linguistic features, and then the vocoders synthesize waveform from acoustic features.
