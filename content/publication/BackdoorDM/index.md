abstract: 'Backdoor learning is a critical research topic for understanding the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks. While it has been extensively studied in discriminative models over the past few years, backdoor learning in diffusion models (DMs) has recently attracted increasing attention, becoming a new research hotspot. Although many different backdoor attack and defense methods have been proposed for DMs, a comprehensive benchmark for backdoor learning in DMs is still lacking. This absence makes it difficult to conduct fair comparisons and thoroughly evaluate existing approaches, thus hindering future research progress. To address this issue, we propose BackdoorDM, the first comprehensive benchmark designed for backdoor learning in DMs. It comprises nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack methods, four SOTA defense strategies, and two helpful visualization analysis tools. We first systematically classify and formulate the existing literature in a unified framework, focusing on three different backdoor attack types and five backdoor target types, which are restricted to a single type in discriminative models. Then, we systematically summarize the evaluation metrics for each type and propose a unified backdoor evaluation method based on GPT-4o. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and highlight several important conclusions. We believe that BackdoorDM will help overcome current barriers and contribute to building a trustworthy DMs community.'
