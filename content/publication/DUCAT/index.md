abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is recognized as one of the most effective methods to enhance the robustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, existing AT methods suffer from an inherent trade-off between adversarial robustness and clean accuracy, which seriously hinders their real-world deployment.
